# About me
Hello there! My name is David, and I was born in '99, so I'm currently @cs{#(DateTime.Now - DateTime.Parse("1999-03-30")).Year#} years old.
I started developing softwares around 2012-2013 in Visual Basic 2010. My first project was a "Web Browser", what uses WebBrowser,
that is available basically in Visual Basic, C#, C++ etc, so that was not a real custom browser engine, but in that time, this was a big milestone for me and my classmates were amazed.
Than I moved this browser to C# and started using Gecko, later I changed it to Chromium. The last version of this browser released in Q1 2014 based on Chromium.

In the end of 2014, I started playing Minecraft. That was a time, when I started my first year in secondary education and many people of my class played this game, so I bought it and joined to play with them.
Around that time, I faced with Forge and modding Minecraft. In the first time, I only use some mods and create modpacks with them, later I started creating custom mods, what are add some new blocks and items to game, but these still doesn't available.
I'm currently working on a mod, what adds a custom main GUI and a new, dynamic server list, that is obtained from our backend.
Also I'm busy creating a Minecraft Launcher called HunLux Launcher based on C# WPF.
In that time, I also created some Spigot/Bukkit plugins, and some of them still available in SpigotMC.org.
I will create spigot plugins and forge mods if someone pays me to make it. // paypal@czompi.hu ;)

So, I have a lot of projects from 2-3 years ago, what I probably never finish...

Currently I couldn't write there anything, so thanks to read all of it.
This is not end of my portfolio, I just very lazy to write all of it, like I started learning C++ in school, and I created a lot of softwares in C# for my workplace, where I work in summers, ecetera, etcetera...
